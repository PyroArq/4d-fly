# 4D SmoothFly

A mod for [4D Miner by Mashpoe](https://mashpoe.com/4d-miner), based on [Tr1NgleDev's 4dm.h modding framework](https://github.com/4D-Modding/4dm.h).

This mods is an improvement on Tr1Ngles 4DFly mod, improving flight in numerous ways.

- Gravity is fully disabled in all edge cases
- your velocity does not jump unpredictably when you fly into walls or the floor
- flight is more snappy
- flight in singleplayer is way faster
- equal feel in all 4 axes
- more stable acceleration and deceleration
- if you fly off a block horizontally, you can fly back on


The Hotkey for flight is F, this mod is intended for use with the 4DKeyBinds mod, but does not require it.
